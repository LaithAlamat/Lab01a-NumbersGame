# Lab01a-NumbersGame

<h1>The steps of creating the code.</h1>

- Follow the steps of the lab sheet step by step.

- First of all create the project from visual studio.

- Call the StartSequeance method in the main method.

- Start creating the start sequence method in which we ask the user to inter an integer which will be the array length.

- This method will call all the other functions and start the program for us.

- Then we create the Populate method which asks the user to inter the values of the array

- Each time the user enters a value it will be a string, we convert it into an integer so we can use it for later calculations.

- Return the array that the user just created.

- Create the Getsum method which takes the userinput which is the array length and will add all of the values in the array by looping over the array and return the value of the sum.

- Create the GetProduct method which will ask the user to enter a random number between 1 and the length they provided previously.

- This method multiplies the sum of the values with a specific index in the array which the user provided previously and return the value of the product.

- Create the GetQuotient method which will ask the user to enter a random number to divide the product by.

- We return the value of the quotient and make sure to that we are dealing with decimals.
